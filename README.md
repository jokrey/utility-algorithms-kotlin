# utility-algorithms-kotlin

Multi purpose utility algorithms.
The algorithms and classes are all each cool, (duh)
   but each not big enough for their own repository.

Some of the algorithms here are implementation of protocols that exist in other "utility-algorithms-*lang*" repos.

As this is Kotlin, the algorithms are also usable with java applications.



How to use:
  For now just copy the whole package into your Project.
